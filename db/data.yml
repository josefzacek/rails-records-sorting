    - 'MacBook was to do the impossible: engineer a full-size experience into the
      lightest and most compact Mac notebook ever. That meant reimagining every element
      to make it not only lighter and thinner but also better. The result is more
      than just a new notebook. It’s the future of the notebook. And now, with sixth-generation
      Intel processors, improved graphics performance, faster flash storage and up
      to 10 hours of battery life,* MacBook is even more capable.'
